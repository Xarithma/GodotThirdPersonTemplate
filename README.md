## Third-person Godot Template

## Quickstart

You can download this template or start a new project on GitHub.

If you would like to get some extra features that are associated with the template but don't want to use the [Easy Godot Features Plugin](https://github.com/Xarithma/EasyGodotFeaturesPlugin), you can download the main branch with all the template's features/variation branches and paste the files of each branch into the project's folder.

Like this:

1. Download the main branch
2. Extract it somewhere which would act as the project's root.
3. Change the branch to whatever feature you might like, download that as a ZIP
4. Extract the new files into the same folder and overwrite all files.
  - Each branch will have an indicator for new files if you don't want to overwrite your changes.
